    <h1>Hello! Welcome to the official website for the Warframe clan Archangel Legion!</h1>
    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>We are a clan founded on the principle that clans are a group of players with a single goal to help others.

        play styles and Mastery Ranks. We are a group focused on helping players to see the bright side of being apart of 
        community. We strive to make every person feel welcome, regardless if they are only passing through. We may be a 
		small, tight knit group of players, but we are always looking for new players to grow our ranks.
